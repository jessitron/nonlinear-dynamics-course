          For homework 1.4, start with the logistic map at r=2, x0=0.2 and x0=0.20001.
          <div class="chart">
            <canvas id="chart1"></canvas>

          You can't
          tell the difference between these.
        </div>
        <div class="first-part second-graph chart-and-text">
          Subtract these two series and zoom in on the difference:
          <div class="chart">
            <canvas id="chart2"></canvas>
          </div>
          The difference goes to zero and stays there.
        </div>
        <div class="second-part first-graph chart-and-text">
          Next take the logistic map at r=3.4, x0=0.2 and x0=0.20001.
          <div class="chart">
            <canvas id="chart3"></canvas>

          This is the 2-cycle attractor.

          Subtract these two series and zoom in on the difference:

            <canvas id="chart4"></canvas>

          Wow, that's a lot jigglier.
        </div>
        <div class="third-part first-graph chart-and-text">
          Finally, take the logistic map at r=3.72, x0=0.2 and x0=0.20001.
          <div class="chart">
            <canvas id="chart5"></canvas>
          </div>
          Oh, now it's chaotic.

        <div class="third-part second-graph chart-and-text">
          Subtract these two series and zoom in on the difference:

          Look at that! They start out super close and then get super far!
