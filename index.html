    <div class="first-part first-graph chart-and-text">
      For homework 1.4, start with the logistic map at r=2, x0=0.2 and x0=0.20001.
      <div class="chart">
        <canvas id="chart1"></canvas>
      </div>
      You can't
      tell the difference between these.
    </div>
    <div class="first-part second-graph chart-and-text">
      Subtract these two series and zoom in on the difference:
      <div class="chart">
        <canvas id="chart2"></canvas>
      </div>
      The difference goes to zero and stays there.
    </div>
    <div class="second-part first-graph chart-and-text">
      Next take the logistic map at r=3.4, x0=0.2 and x0=0.20001.
      <div class="chart">
        <canvas id="chart3"></canvas>
      </div>
      This is the 2-cycle attractor.

    <div class="second-part second-graph chart-and-text">
      Subtract these two series and zoom in on the difference:
      <div class="chart">
        <canvas id="chart4"></canvas>
      </div>
      Wow, that's a lot jigglier.
    </div>
    <div class="third-part first-graph chart-and-text">
      Finally, take the logistic map at r=3.72, x0=0.2 and x0=0.20001.
      <div class="chart">
        <canvas id="chart5"></canvas>
      </div>
      Oh, now it's chaotic.

    <div class="third-part second-graph chart-and-text">
      Subtract these two series and zoom in on the difference:
      <div class="chart">

      Look at that! They start out super close and then get super far!

    <div class="first-part third-answer">
      The 500th iterates differ by <span id="answer1"></span>
